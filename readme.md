Keez - Naive Java Embeddable Key Value Store
============================================

This is a simple embeddable java key-value store that I use it when 
I need something simple for a prototype or a cheap service.

Api "Features":
 
* async/callback semantics
* optimistic locking (using revision numbers)   

Docs:

* see Example.java for an example usage 
* see Keez.java for some documentation

The only provided implementation 'KeezFileDb' is cheap and dirty but will work.
