Keez - Naive Java Embeddable Key Value Store
============================================

This is a simple embeddable java key-value store that I use it when 
I need something simple for a prototype or a cheap service.

Api "Features": 
	- async/callback semantics
	- optimistic locking (using revision numbers)   

Example.java for an example usage 
Keez.java for some documentation docs

The only provided implementation 'KeezFileDb' is cheap and dirty.
